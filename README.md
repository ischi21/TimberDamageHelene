# Hurricane Helene's Effect on Western North Carolina's Woodland 
## This map features a bivariate design focusing on the acreage of timber lost alongside Western NC's State Park locations. Helene brought historic and unanticipated flooding to the region, causing damage to the region's forests. The choropleth aspect features the Wester North Carolina counties impacted by total acreage of damage. The point features represent the state parks within the impacted areas. These damages to the forests will not only affect the wood industry but the tourist industry as well. We have seen the effects directly after the storm with the closure of certain parks and roads, specifically the Blue Ridge Parkway, a feature that is the heart of the region's tourist industry. It's critical to asses how these areas are being affected today.
